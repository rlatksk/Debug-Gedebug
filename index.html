        <p>
          We chose the name "Debug Gedebug" to reflect our group's dynamic
          approach to IT exploration. "Debug" encapsulates our commitment to
          delving into the intricacies of technology, uncovering solutions to
          complex challenges. Simultaneously, "Gedebug," which translates to
          "noise" in Indonesian, embodies our belief in the power of
          collaboration and the vibrant exchange of ideas within our team. Just
          as debugging involves deciphering noise from signal, our group
          embraces the diverse perspectives and creativity each member brings,
          harmonizing them into innovative IT solutions.
